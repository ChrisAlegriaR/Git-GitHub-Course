# 🐙 Git & GitHub Course

## 📖 Course, Branches and Project Description  
This repository is composed of three parts:

1. **Git & GitHub Course**:  
   In the **`course/`** folder, you will find my personal notes on the basic and practical concepts of Git and GitHub that I learned in the **SergieCode** course. This course provides the fundamental knowledge needed to understand and practice version control, including commit creation, branching, merging, rebasing, remote management, GitHub usage and collaboration workflows. These notes include step-by-step explanations, screenshots, and real command examples applied during the learning process.

2. **Branches**:  
   Instead of small coding exercises, this repository uses **multiple Git branches** created intentionally as part of the course. These branches were used to practice real Git workflows such as merging, resolving conflicts, switching between histories, performing rebases, rewriting commit history, and pushing to remote repositories. Each branch represents a different practical scenario used to reinforce version-control concepts.

3. **Documentation Assets**:  
   Throughout the course, I also generated different screenshots, Git logs, diagrams, and annotated examples that were used to document the steps performed during practice. These visual elements help illustrate how Git behaves internally and externally when performing each operation.

### ⚖️ Use of Non-Owned Content  
In all parts of this repository (course, branches, and documentation), **multimedia resources** (such as icons, diagrams, screenshots of tools, or sample repository structures) that are not my own work have been used. These resources belong to their respective creators and companies. They are used exclusively for educational purposes, within the context of the course and documentation, and **are not for commercial use**. All copyright over the visual content belongs to the respective original creators.

### 🔑 Educational Purpose  
The main goal of this repository is to learn and practice Git and GitHub, as well as to apply version-control logic and real-world collaboration workflows. Any multimedia resources used in the documentation are **purely educational** and **non-commercial**. Throughout the development of these materials, I have implemented **my own work**, such as detailed notes, screenshots, branch operations, commit experiments, and additional improvements to strengthen the learning process.

## 💼 Project Structure  

### 📂 Folders  
- **`course/`**: Contains all the notes and examples related to the basic and practical concepts of Git and GitHub that I learned in the **SergieCode** course.  

### 🌿 Branches  
- Contains the different Git branches created to practice version-control workflows. Each branch represents a specific topic or exercise, including merges, rebases, conflict resolution, detached HEAD experiments, rewriting commits, and pushing changes to remote repositories. These branches form part of the course material itself.

### ⚠️ Important  
The **notes and Git operations** in this repository are **my own work**, written and executed by me during the course and branch development. The only elements that do not belong to me are the multimedia resources (icons, diagrams, tool screenshots, etc.), which have been used exclusively for educational purposes, always respecting the copyright of the original creators.  

- The **course** includes examples and resources taken for educational purposes, respecting the copyright of the original creators.  
- The **Git branches** and documentation examples were created with the same purpose: to practice what I learned in the **SergieCode** course. All multimedia resources used are owned by their respective authors and companies and are used for educational purposes, respecting the copyright.

💻 *These branches, documentation assets, and notes were made for educational purposes, based on the **SergieCode** course, and with the goal of learning and practicing Git & GitHub.*  

## 🏆 Acknowledgments and Mentions  
I would like to express my deepest gratitude to teacher `©SergieCode` for his invaluable contribution to my learning in the Git & GitHub course. Thanks to his clear explanations, practical approach, and generosity in sharing his knowledge, this project has become possible. His dedication and effort have been essential to expanding my horizons and taking my learning to a higher level. I deeply thank him for being such an inspiring and committed instructor.

I also want to extend my deepest recognition to the creators of the multimedia resources used in this repository. The **visual**, **diagram**, and **screenshot** content belongs to their respective authors and companies, and without their material, this project would not have been able to reach the quality and clarity it presents today. I am very grateful for the work and dedication they have put into creating these resources. I apologize for any inconvenience, and with the utmost respect, I thank them for allowing us to access them for educational purposes. I have made sure to select the highest-quality resources to honor their efforts and dedication.

## 🗣️ Project Language  
All the content in this repository, both in the **branches**, **documentation**, and the **course**, is in **Spanish**. I have chosen to keep the content in this language because it is a **personal** project, and it is easier for me to understand and organize the information in Spanish. This choice has allowed me to work more efficiently and in greater detail in the notes and documentation. **Only the repository description and this README will be in English**, to ensure that it is accessible to a wider audience, while maintaining a clear and understandable educational focus.
